My customers will say that is too much to pay, and I\n          agree—but if you don’t pay, you don’t taste. Lately, I have been combining anchovies with nectarines, which I\n          love.

We think parsnip will work\n          instead of carrot and that kabocha squash will work instead of pumpkin in a pie.\nWhen people see eggplant in a dessert they automatically think it will not work. You have to\n          hide the unusual element and play up what people know already. The boundaries are limitless when you think of\n          all the crossovers between sweet and savory. Duck à l’orange is a fruit and meat combined, so why not use\n          bacon\n          in a dessert? A pancake with maple syrup and bacon on the plate is really sweet and savory. So people already\n          eat these combinations unconsciously.\nFor our apple-eggplant dessert, we start with a choux dough piecrust. Then we layer\n          an almond cream-like custard. Then we alternate apple and eggplant slices side by side. We\n          use\n          baby eggplant because it has a spongy texture and sucks up moisture from the cream that can otherwise make the\n          crust soggy and absorb the juice and flavor from the apples that would normally just evaporate.

                "I have always been very fond of chef Frédy Girardet [who earned three\n          Michelin stars at his restaurant in Switzerland before retiring in 1996]. When I was young, I cooked almost\n          every recipe from his book and visited his restaurant. One of his most interesting desserts was an\n          apple dessert made of apples in the shape of little balls. The dessert broke away from\n          cooking\n          apples whole in the traditional way, which alone inspired me. He cooked them over a very high heat for two\n          minutes and put them into a red wine reduction that had cinnamon, orange peel, and sugar. This was put onto a\n          sheet tray that needed to be shaken for an hour so the apples would not dry out. The apples would absorb these\n          flavors like a sponge and would then be served with vanilla ice cream.\nIn that spirit, we transformed this dessert. We transformed the wine by “espherication” so\n          that it creates a bubble of liquid that explodes in your mouth. We cut apples with a melon baller, then\n          vacuum-packed the apples with the wine but cooked it in such a way that the apples stayed hard and absorbed\n          the\n          wine flavor.",

I try not to use pumpkin until close to Halloween, because no\n          matter what you do with it, it will still taste like pumpkin. It’s not like berries or apples that you can do\n          a\n          thousand things with. As a pastry chef, if I serve pumpkin too soon, people will get sick of it—and if I take\n          it\n          off the menu, there is nothing to replace it with. So I try to wait so I don’t peak too early.\nFigs are great for fall. The problem with figs is that there are not that many fig lovers\n          out\n          there. There are a lot more peach, chocolate, and apple lovers than there are fig lovers. When I make a fig\n          dessert, I’ll pair it with a raspberry or late summer fruit so it’s more likely to meet with customer\n          acceptance.\nIn the fall, I’ll make more cakes. Fall also turns into caramel season, and fall fruits work\n          so well with caramel. I keep a lighter hand with caramel in the fall because it is being combined with fruit\n          versus chocolate.",

The bacon brings complexity to the pork; the cherry brings acid balance; and the almond brings a\n          different kind of fat with crunch.

Then I’d add the\n          shucked fava beans and let them cook with a little water. At the last second, I’d toss in some chopped parsley\n          or basil, and there’s your sauce.

We don’t braise our ribs in red wine, but in Yuengling Porter,\n          which has ethereal chocolate notes in the aroma. In the sauce with the beer is mirepoix, a sachet of herbs,\n          lots\n          of peppercorns, and chiles. I went to a charity event where they served short ribs for six hundred guests, and\n          one reason it worked is because it is a cut that allows for a great margin of error. You cook it until it is\n          well done and falling-off-the-bone tender. Falling-offthe-bone tender is one of the appeals of a braised dish.\n          It is sensual. Get yourself a glass of good spicy Syrah with that short rib dish and think great\n          thoughts!",

                "Hanger steak is known as an onglet in French and\n          is\n          found on bistro menus. It is also a great value, which is why you see it on menus in smaller restaurants. A\n          hanger steak is incredibly flavorful. There is only one per carcass, and it comes from the area close to the\n          kidneys, so it has almost an offal flavor to the beef. It has become popular because it is different and not a\n          typical-tasting steak. I like a hanger steak grilled and served rare to medium rare. Slicing is also\n          important,\n          because you have to cut it on the bias so that it is tender. I like a hanger steak served with a traditional\n          sauce, such as a caramelized shallot and red wine sauce or a bourbon peppercorn sauce. It is important to\n          caramelize the shallots so they get sweet and offset the gaminess of the steak. I use bourbon instead of\n          cognac\n          because it has more punch to it, and I’ll use four different peppercorns—white, black, pink, and green—with\n          the\n          last two modulating the flavor. Green peppercorns have the sharpness to cut through the richness.",

                "Rib steak is the most popular cut next to filet mignon.\n          The\n          cut comes from the rib roast, where one end meets the chuck at the fattier end and the other meets the short\n          loin at the leaner end. The rib steak that meets the chuck end is the most popular and can even have a big\n          knot\n          of fat in it. This is one of my favorite steaks. A big, fatty, juicy rib steak can’t be beat on the grill. I\n          cook these bone-on because it gives more beef flavor. We do a Brandt Ranch cut that comes from California just\n          north of Mexico. That area has lots of flavor influences, so I choose to do a chili rub on the steak. The cut\n          is\n          Holstein, which has a sweeter edge to its meat. We grill it so that fat melts away and bastes it as it cooks.\n          At\n          the end, we brush it with a blend of ancho chili, light brown sugar, toasted ground cumin seeds, chipotle\n          chile,\n          and a pinch of cayenne. Then we char it one more time, so that is like reseasoning the meat.",

                "Customers are picky at brunch. They have all cooked what\n          they think they like, they think they can do it slightly better than we can, and they want it twice as fast.\n          So,\n          we take the classics like pancakes or French toast, use them as building blocks, and push them a little\n          further.\nWe will offer seasonal pancakes. In the winter, we’ll make buckwheat pancakes with cinnamon\n          and glazed oranges. Bridging spring into summer, we’ll offer corn and saffron pancakes with a spicy poached\n          pear\n          and fresh ricotta. Saffron and corn work really well together because of the floral nature of the saffron and\n          sweetness of the corn. We will use poached pears on the pancakes until switching to blueberries for the\n          summer,\n          which give a real pop. The pears are poached in a red wine syrup with aleppo chile that is a sundried\n          chile with a rich, round, sweet spice to it. The chile is not noticeable, but it acts like an acid by\n          lightening, plus cutting the sugar and richness of, the pancake.\nWhen people eat pancakes, they naturally reach for butter. I don’t serve butter with my\n          pancakes and instead serve fresh ricotta. We use ricotta from Anne Saxelby, who supplies us with a fresh,\n          rich,\n          velvety ricotta, and this gives a richness to the dish.",

The process is simple but a little tricky, as it keeps\n          cooking\n          even after it is off the stove. Something you can do to improve it is—halfway through the cooking\n          process—start\n          whisking the butter, because it intensifies the flavor if you keep the particles suspended.",

Luckily, I recently found these short, fat carrots at the green market. We sauté these carrots over\n          an open fire so that they get a little smoky. When they are cooked, they become soft and creamy. Once cooked,\n          we\n          turn them into a puree with a shot of carrot juice at the last second. We pair this with farro that has been\n          cooked like risotto, then add some pine nuts and more Thumbelina carrots that have been quartered. I don’t\n          know\n          what is more seductive: the smooth carrot farro with its light carrot flavor or the carrots themselves that\n          are\n          totally creamy. The dish has no butter or cream but that is not because we are trying to be healthy. The dish\n          just doesn’t need it.",

So now we do a carrot base with cooked organic carrots with tops, onions, garlic, and\n          maybe some ginger and lemongrass. With that base we make a really thick soup and then add carrot juice to it.\n          In\n          the end you have fresh and cooked carrots for a better flavor profile.",

This recommends fruits especially—and makes a great start to the\n          day:\n          cheese, some high-fiber vitamin C–rich fruit, some whole grain organic bread, and coffee. The breads I prefer\n          with cheese are usually neutral flavored, though I fully appreciate the nutty or herbed or fruity breads as\n          natural partners for cheeses. The main reason I prefer neutral flavors in my breads is because I don’t want to\n          meddle with the flavors in the cheeses themselves. I’m kind of a purist on that! Usually, the softer the\n          cheese,\n          the harder the bread—to an extent. And high-pectin, high-fiber fruits [e.g., apples, pears, apricots, plums,\n          nectarines, peaches, figs] make natural accompaniments for many, many cheeses.\nWhich cheeses? My faves with my espresso to which I add a little unfiltered raw honey would\n          be\n          the pressed sheep milk cheeses: Ossau Iraty, Roncal, Zamorano, Berkswell, Spenwood, Trade Lake Cedar, Vermont\n          Shepherd, manchego, or Pecorino Foglie Noce. But I’m happy with whatever is looking good, and preferably the\n          harder aged cheeses: sheep, goat, or cow.",

With an aged or hard cheese, I like to serve some chestnut honey, a fruit jam, or watermelon\n          confiture. If I have some aged goat cheese, I like a mostarda [Italian mustard fruit].

I love mountain Gorgonzola with chestnut honey; it is crazy! In Italy, we call jam a confitura\n          or\n          marmalata. I like it with saltier cheeses like Parmesan, or with more assertive cheeses.\n          Mostarda is made of fruits cooked in a white wine mustard syrup until they are candied. So, you have\n          a\n          sweet candy effect with the spicy mustard. It goes with any savory firm cheese, and particularly well with\n          pecorino and Taleggio.",

The slightly caramelized sugar made a huge difference in the flavor. I used a goat cream\n          cheese\n          worked to a texture similar to mascarpone cheese, which I shaped into quenelles.

This was then set on an\n          orange-soaked chestnut sponge cake, next to a chestnut wafer and chestnut paste. I needed a complementary\n          flavor, and I have always liked the combination of pear and chestnut. They both have a richness but depending\n          on\n          how the pear is handled, it can add freshness and acidity. I roasted the pear in sugar, butter, and ice wine\n          vinegar and finished it in the oven until soft. The pear was then diced tartare-like and had orange confit\n          added. The juices from the pear were the only sauce.",

The foie gras is cooked separately and made into a terrine. The dish is then\n          served with gingery pickled vegetables. It is not a Chinese dish in that it is not a dish that you would find\n          in\n          a Chinese restaurant, but it has Chinese influences. The idea of clarifying the broth is typically French. The\n          use of foie gras is not very Chinese. The pickled vegetables are like something you might find in Chinese\n          cooking, but they are done in perfect dice and served as a relish.",

Corn dates back to the Aztecs, who also loved\n          chocolate, so it’s funny when people ask, “Where’d you get the inspiration?” This starts with\n          a\n          layer of milk chocolate hazelnut praline paste, then the corn, and then crushed wafers that give it that Kit\n          Kat\n          candy bar texture; on top of that is some chocolate ganache, then a layer of chocolate. To play off those\n          flavors I serve some espelette [pepper] to give a little heat and some smoked salt from Wales. This\n          dish is about the interplay of the chocolate and the corn. The espelette gives a heat that reminds me\n          of roasted corn salsa. This is an ode to the origin of the inspiration.",

                "When it comes to chocolate, keep it simple. That’s always\n          good advice! For simplicity at its best, only two ingredients are necessary: heavy cream and chopped\n          chocolate.\n          Bring the cream to a boil, pour it over the chocolate, and it turns into ganache. Serve it warm with just a\n          spoon. How can you do any better? In my new book, I feature a recipe called Cup O’ Dark Chocolate, and\n          essentially it is ganache poured into a cup. Then you grab a cookie, and have at it!\nIf you want to dip fruit into chocolate, dried fruits such as figs, pear, and pineapple all\n          work really well. People always ask what they can serve to impress their sweetheart on Valentine’s Day, and\n          fresh strawberries are really nice in February. Just make a warm ganache, grab the strawberries, and start\n          dipping. Fresh grapes are fantastic with chocolate. Dip them into the melted chocolate, pop them in the\n          freezer,\n          and when they are frozen, put them into a two-quart container. That way, you will always have a little treat\n          in\n          the freezer. Be careful though—they are not M&Ms, so they will melt in your hands!",

                "People always ask why I use bittersweet versus semisweet\n          chocolate. Semisweet is chocolate that needs salt. When you add salt to it, it brings up the\n          bitter flavor and makes it taste bittersweet. Semisweet chocolate to me tastes kind of flat. Milk chocolate\n          can\n          taste flat as well. Now that there is Scharffen Berger and El Rey on the market, I find both those chocolates\n          to\n          be really, really great, with both flavor and kick to them. But if you want a killer chocolate dessert, don’t\n          use milk chocolate.\nWhen I write a dessert menu, there will be a couple of chocolate desserts, with one being a\n          killer chocolate and the other a lighter option, like chocolate with bananas. If you don’t have something\n          intensely chocolate, chocolate lovers are very, very unhappy. Banana soufflé with chocolate is not considered\n          a\n          chocolate dessert. You have to be careful with a killer chocolate dessert—you can’t just put chocolate,\n          chocolate, and chocolate together. There has to be balance so the dessert is not too rich. To achieve balance,\n          turn to coffee or caramel because they pair so well and help to intensify the chocolate flavor.\nFor some desserts, I like to combine white and dark chocolate, or milk and dark chocolate,\n          to\n          give balance and cut intensity. It sounds crazy, but you can use one chocolate to mellow the flavor of\n          another.\nI’m not a fan of herbs with dessert, with the possible exception of chocolate.

When you are making a dessert with white chocolate, it is going to be a softer, smoother\n          dessert.\n          I don’t like dark chocolate and raspberries together, but I believe I am one of the few chefs who feel this\n          way.\n          What I don’t like is that when you take a bite of the chocolate with the berry, the acidity of the two don’t\n          blend. The acids are too similar, so it doesn’t feel like a single dessert in your mouth. Instead, it is a\n          clash\n          with both of them bouncing into each other in your mouth. They don’t bridge, and even whipped cream doesn’t\n          bring them together. But if you use white chocolate, its softness works much better with berries. The white\n          chocolate complements the berries and brings out their flavors. Citrus, especially anything in the orange\n          family, also works well with white chocolate.

So I had to figure out how\n          to\n          make a sauce out of a dried piece of sausage. We melted the chorizo in a pan for a long time, and ended up\n          with\n          a flavorful grease that was not that appealing. However, we emulsified it in an herb-infused clam broth, and\n          it\n          became velvety. It wasn’t greasy, and gave the sauce a little kick. I chose this sauce to go with monkfish\n          because it is a meaty fish and can stand up to spice and to strong flavors really well. Chorizo would not\n          destroy the soul of the fish.",

                "My coconut rice pudding strudel was the result of\n          Takashi’s\n          influence. [Takashi Yagihashi was his chef at Detroit’s Tribute restaurant.] Dessert has to make sense in the\n          context of the rest of the meal. Being a pastry chef is exciting because you have a lot of autonomy, but you\n          are\n          still working within the chef’s framework. Takashi’s food was very Asian-influenced. This dish was meant to\n          bring in Asian ingredients in a new way yet be something familiar.\nSo we have rice pudding flavored with coconut, lemongrass, ginger, and vanilla, and diced\n          apricot for texture. At the time I was introduced to frie de brique, which is a Moroccan dough that\n          is\n          like a cross between phyllo and a wonton wrapper. I would wrap these ingredients in this dough and then sauté\n          them in clarified butter and slice them like a spring roll. Alongside I served green tea ice cream. This\n          covered\n          a lot of bases for me: the warm and cold temperatures, the Asian influence, and doing something with boring\n          old\n          rice pudding.\nThe coolest compliment I ever got was from Andrew Carmellini [chef of New York’s A Voce] who\n          was sitting down with us and asked about my background. When I said I used to be a line cook, he said, “I knew\n          it—a pastry chef would never come up with that!” It was the combination of techniques and flavors as well as\n          sautéing something to order.",

                "We participate in an event called “Plate and Pitchfork” that is held on a\n          farm with the food from the farm. The guests sit in the field among the corn and tomatoes,\n          and\n          we cook a meal for them on a couple of grills.\nI made a corn soup for this event. We removed the husks, then cut the kernels off the cob.\n          Then we used the husks, which produce a juice, to make a stock for the soup. If you were to use cobs, you\n          wouldn’t get the same flavor. It is important to keep the corn flavor pure. Most cooks would throw in a bunch\n          of\n          vegetables in the stock, and what you’d get then is a vegetable stock with corn. I want to have a corny flavor\n          in the end. We made a stock using the corn husks cooked with a little onion, water, and salt, and let it cook\n          for about 45 minutes. What came out was the most amazing sweet broth. We added the corn, pureed it, and served\n          it chilled. It was so sweet and full of corn flavor you would have sworn there were cream and sugar in\n          it.\nWe now make a corn husk broth to add to a corn, chanterelle, and Dungeness crab risotto with\n          a\n          touch of pesto. Basil pesto and corn really speaks to me. It is a wonderful combination.",

I begged Lee [Hefter, the chef]\n          for his source! Surf and turf is not as much about having a piece of meat and fish on the plate as about the\n          ideas they create for flavor combinations. The Kobe beef triggered everything. I can’t serve steak at a fish\n          restaurant, but the Kobe was so good I had to find a way to justify it on the menu. I came up with Kobe beef\n          and\n          escalar, with a brown butter that is classic with the fish. The final dish was inspired by\n          having Korean barbecue at a friend’s house, which is when I realized how to bring it together.\nI wanted another element in the dish because the Kobe, escalar, and brown butter are all\n          rich\n          and all soft. The dish also has squash, Japanese pears, and napa cabbage marinated like Korean kimchee for\n          just\n          a moment. These elements add contrast, chewiness, and crunchiness.",

                "Fennel is a flavor I like so much that I have to show\n          restraint with it. You can add anything to it because other flavors really adhere to it. You can braise it in\n          olive oil and veal stock to get one flavor. Or you can braise it in olive oil, white wine, and water and get a\n          whole other flavor. Or you can quarter it, caramelize it, and roast it in the oven—now you have a sugar flavor\n          and it can become a dessert. I love fennel every way including braised, caramelized, dried, candied, and\n          pureed.\n          In the fall, I served raw shaved fennel with arugula, and shaved Honeycrisp apple with a dressing made of\n          apple\n          cider, honey, and mustard. Fennel puts the salad over the top with its crunch. In summer, we serve a fennel\n          and\n          fig tarte tatin with duck. You get a Fig Newton flavor from the fig and Pernod flavor from the fennel; they\n          match really well.",

The\n          tarte\n            flambée developed from what was on hand on the farm: cheese and cream from the cow, pork from the pig,\n          and onions from the field, which they added to some dough. Since we don’t have a wood-burning oven [in the\n          middle of Manhattan], we have to tweak the recipe from the classic. We have to tweak the cream because if we\n          don’t, it breaks and just becomes grease. Instead, I use a mix of fromage blanc, cream, and sour cream so I\n          can\n          get the same result as cream in the original. And to compensate for not having a fire, I use an\n          applewood-smoked\n          bacon.",

                "Halibut from the East Coast is the most delicate and silky\n          fish. It is different than Alaskan halibut, which is drier, meatier, and more robust. East Coast halibut is so\n          delicate that anything can kill it. That is why we steam and poach so much here: Even searing it too strongly\n          in\n          the pan will hurt a piece of halibut.\nWe’ll poach halibut, then serve it with a blood orange vinaigrette made with extra-virgin\n          olive oil, which gives it a round and full flavor. The fish is then served atop a carpaccio of golden beets\n          that\n          have been cooked in sherry vinegar. The beets have a sweet-and-sour flavor to them. They are also very\n          crunchy,\n          which I like with the creamy texture of the halibut. The vinaigrette brings the right degree of acidity to the\n          dish to make it exciting.",

If\n          you\n          roast a rib eye, prime rib, or filet mignon, most people would put it on a sheet tray with a roasting rack.\n          One\n          day, I didn’t have a roasting rack but I had a lot of thyme and savory and rosemary, so I threw the meat on\n          top\n          and roasted it. The technique did the trick by keeping the meat from the juices and it also enhanced the\n          flavor\n          that much more. Since then, we have stopped using roasting racks for our meats and switched to herbs. During\n          the\n          roasting process, I like to turn the meat so that the flavor of the herbs penetrates even more. Since you are\n          roasting in a closed oven, the air circulates the herb flavor.\nFor a lamb shoulder, if you can’t get hay, I would recommend using savory, thyme, sage, and\n          rosemary. This technique is great for a whole chicken: slice some truffles to put under the chicken skin,\n          brush\n          it with butter, and put it on a bed of savory and thyme. It will be pretty incredible.",

                "In Eastern European or Hungarian cooking, you will see a\n          stewed or braised dish flavored with paprika that is cut with sour cream either in it or served on top so that\n          it mixes together as you eat it. I serve rare roasted venison in venison stock with hot and sweet paprika that\n          is essentially a goulash. Alongside, I serve creamed sauerkraut that bleeds into the sauce and gives the same\n          effect as a goulash. Even though the sauerkraut has an intense flavor, it is still mild because it has been\n          cooked in cream. It is not a Hungarian dish but rather a play on a Hungarian dish, and it works in the context\n          of the subtler intensity of flavors I like.",

I can’t precisely\n          place\n          its flavor, which is somewhere between a turnip, radish, and cauliflower. But it tastes great and is really\n          versatile. You can grill it, roast it, glaze it like a carrot, or make a gratin out of it with potatoes. We\n          have\n          even grated it and made a rémoulade out of it like you would with a celery root. But the best way to enjoy\n          kohlrabi is grilled, roasted, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt. That is my favorite!",

It is a dish about technique because if the garlic is cooked too long, it gets bitter. Or\n          if\n          you add too much fenugreek, it gets bitter and overpowers the cream.

                "I work with a local lamb farmer in the Willamette Valley\n          who\n          has true spring lamb in the spring. We have a spit and every Friday night we roast a whole lamb. I am a big\n          fan\n          of lamb shoulder. It can take a beating and in the end come out glorious tasting! There is an old French\n          technique where they cook ham in hay. The hay is submerged in water; then they put the ham on it to cook. It\n          is\n          amazing. We adapted this technique to the lamb. We had our farmer collect the hay and grass in the field where\n          the lamb grazed with the thinking that this is what the lamb actually ate. We then dry the hay by letting it\n          sit\n          out overnight on a tray, so it becomes really butterscotchy and barnyardy. You can use any hay for this\n          technique but I’m just a purist.\nWe brine a boneless shoulder of lamb for 24 hours in a brining solution of 1 cup of salt and\n          ¼\n          cup of sugar in a gallon of water, [adding] some peppercorns, bay leaf, a couple of cardamom pods, a cinnamon\n          stick, and cumin. The brine is brought to a boil, cooled down, and the lamb goes in. After the brining we rub\n          the lamb with garlic and summer savory and tie it up into a log and put it on the bed of hay, drizzle it with\n          white wine, cover it, and put it in the oven. It is nature going back on itself. The lamb ate the hay, the hay\n          makes the lamb taste better. When it’s cooked, the flavors are intense but pleasant and it becomes something\n          else. When lavender is in season, I’ll throw some in the hay as well and it is delicious.\nWith the lamb I like to serve a stuffed tomato Provençal [typically a combination of basil,\n          bread crumbs, garlic, olive oil]. You want to serve something simple. You could also serve a crushed potato\n          with\n          savory and olive oil or a medley of vegetables.",

In the summertime, I like it\n          with small potatoes and corn. I really like it with cilantro.\nFor my dish Roasted Maine Lobster in “Folly of Herbs” with Baby Fennel and Salsify, I wanted\n          to do something different with lobster besides a lobster sauce. I make a “tea” of dried herbs: thyme,\n          rosemary,\n          fennel seeds, oregano, sage, mint, and tarragon. This is boiled and strained, then gets a dash of Ricard [also\n          known as Pernod, an aniseflavored liquor]. The lobster gets finished with fresh parsley, mint, and fresh\n          oregano. I chose these two vegetables because salsify is underused and underappreciated. I don’t blanch my\n          salsify in water because when you do, the flavor stays in the water. I roast them and caramelize them a little\n          bit, then deglaze with just a little water with a sprig of thyme and a bay leaf. Baby fennel is good because\n          it\n          plays off the Ricard and fennel. I quickly blanch the fennel and then caramelize it.",

If you are doing an entrée that requires\n          last-minute time in the kitchen, don’t serve a dessert that requires last-minute time as well. If you have a\n          main course that takes last-minute work, serve a dessert that can be made a day ahead—or if your dessert is\n          what\n          needs last-minute attention, serve it after a stew or lasagna. When deciding what to make, remember: The\n          heavier\n          the main course, the lighter the dessert should be, or vice versa. I was recently going through some of my\n          earlier books and was shocked when I looked at the recipes. One recipe for a chocolate cake that we served at\n          Stars was served in big wedges. I was amazed we used to serve such a huge portion! People can’t eat like that\n          anymore. At the same time, the cake is so good I still want to serve it so I work backward. I will serve a\n          chicken or something else light for the main course, not a prime rib of beef.",

An example of this would\n          be\n          a [Mexican-inspired] nacho dish we just created. You get something that looks like chips,\n          sour\n          cream, salsa verde, and grated cheese. The cheese is actually grated from saffron ice cream that we\n          have thrown into liquid nitrogen, that is put into a food processor grater. The salsa verde is made\n          from kiwi, mint puree, and epozote to give it a little twist. The sour cream is a yuzu crème fraîche. The\n          chips\n          are made from pureed corn tortilla chips that have been sweetened with powdered sugar, then pasted into\n          triangles and deep fried.

If you have a lemon tart that is mostly perfectly balanced lemon curd with a little whipped cream and\n          you add a mint leaf to the dessert, the leaf will play havoc with that balance.

                "Good cooking transcends all cultures. You can take inspiration from all\n          around the world and apply it to what you are cooking without making it “fusion.” In some cases, you can even\n          take a classic and make it taste better. I worked with Floyd Cardoz [chef of the Indian restaurant Tabla in\n          New\n          York City] and learned a lot about Indian spicing and technique from him. One technique was turka,\n          which is where you fry spices in oil or ghee [Indian clarified butter] until they pop. It really opens up the\n          flavor of the spices.\nI use this cross-cultural technique when making a veal dish with a great\n          mustard sauce, which is a classic French dish, and the result is not a fusion dish: Take\n          black,\n          yellow, and red mustard seeds and toast them in butter or olive oil until they pop; then add some shallots and\n          vermouth and reduce it. Then, add veal stock with a splash of cream and Dijon mustard. The result is a very\n          complex sauce with a much deeper flavor, versus simply combining some cream and mustard together in the\n          pan.",

Pecans have so much moisture that if you chop them, you lose what is special about their\n          texture. People tend to put nuts into the food processor and the next thing you know, you have powder and not\n          pieces.\nWe always toast our nuts, 100 percent of the time. Nuts absorb a lot of\n          moisture, so by toasting them you dry them out and heighten the flavor. You do need to be careful, because\n          they\n          burn so easily. Slower roasting is better. With a nut like a cashew, you want to roast them at 325 degrees to\n          get them to be a nice, golden brown.",

You want a good olive flavor. I\n            use\n            a 100 percent Italian blend. It is silly to cook with 100 percent extra-virgin olive oil if you are just\n            sautéing something. If the oil is going to stay in what you are making, like a sauce, then start with\n            extra-virgin olive oil. When I make a tomato sauce, that is what I am starting with.\nIf you are finishing a dish, that is also when you would use an assertive, more\n            full-flavored oil. I also like to use nut oils, especially those made by Jean Leblanc. They\n            are insane; his oils are so good that after you taste them, nothing else will do! I especially like to use\n            nut\n            oils in the fall. I use walnut oil dressing on salads, especially those salads that accompany meat. If you\n            make a foie gras dish with apples and endive, an addition of walnut oil would be great.",

On the other hand, if you make a Maître d’hôtel\n          butter\n          [butter flavored with lemon juice and parsley] and put it on the steak, the parsley has a role there. On\n          vegetables, if you make glazed carrots or pearl onions or a stew with lots of vegetables, parsley stirred in\n          at\n          the last moment is good stuff. As for my choice of parsley, I always use flat Italian-style parsley.\n      ",

                "Salsa verde is my favorite all-purpose condiment at home. I like\n          it\n          on fish, lamb, and steak.

I add the acid at the last moment so it won’t change the color of the herbs, and\n          will\n          choose between Banyuls or red wine vinegar, or lemon juice. If I am serving meat, I will use vinegar; if I am\n          serving fish, I will use lemon. Even though it changes color once the acid is added, it lasts a few days.

I love\n          pork belly—it is a poor man’s foie gras, the way it just melts in your mouth. I make the eggs in a double\n          boiler\n          that gives them a creamy texture, and finish them with fresh herbs. For the belly, we grill it and then braise\n          it in citrus, champagne vinegar, and veal stock for six hours. Then at serving, we grill it again and top it\n          with a “sweet heat” sauce which is like a barbecue sauce with layers and layers of flavor.",

                "A dish I am really proud of is our saddle of rabbit served\n          with green olives, shallots, marjoram, and fennel jam. This is a light and beautifully balanced dish that\n          reminds me of Liguria [in Italy]. The olives are salty, the marjoram is strong, and the fennel is sweet. This\n          has been on our menu for over a year but it took me a few tries to get right. I tried black olives, but they\n          were too strong. I tried rosemary, but it was too earthy. I tried Brussels sprouts, but they were a little too\n          bitter and didn’t complement the same way sweet fennel did. So though the combination didn’t work for the\n          saddle, the black olives and rosemary led me to add some rabbit liver and stuff a whole boned rabbit. That\n          dish\n          did work. The two dishes were different in the sense that the saddle with the green olives was a little more\n          sophisticated while the whole rabbit was more of a peasant dish. Customers like both!",

If I am making a sauce, even in the\n          middle of summer I will use frozen raspberries. You can use frozen fruit as long as it doesn’t have sugar or\n          anything else added. The fruit is picked in the field when it is ripe and frozen right away. So, the frozen\n          raspberries will have better flavor than those that have been put in a little carton and shipped across the\n          country. Of course, local farmers’ market raspberries are a different story. If I am making a sauce in the\n          summer, the frozen raspberries will taste great. On the other hand, you would not use frozen raspberries on\n          top\n          of a tart.",

                "Floral flavors, when done well, can be really amazing. This is also special\n          because it is something that I never grew up with. Someone from India may not find it a big deal.\nI tend to think in threes. I’ll pair two classic ingredients, and add a third to elevate the\n          combination. I make my own rose-flavored dessert that was inspired by [French pastry chef]\n          Pierre Hermé and his rose macaroon with raspberry and lychee, which is one of the greatest things I have\n          tasted\n          in my life. I coat a standard tart shell with a layer of liquid raspberry; on top of that I place a rose\n          parfait, which I pair with lemon and pistachio. To make the rose flavor not so overbearing, I use it in three\n          different forms. I infuse rosebuds [used to make rosewater] in the milk for the parfait, and I also use rose\n          syrup, which adds color and sweetness, and finally rosewater as well. You have to be careful with rose because\n          it can be like eating perfume. That is why I take a lot of care using three layers to make it one\n          flavor.\n      ",

                "I wanted to come up with a panna cotta that was unlike anyone\n          else’s. I was walking down the street thinking of Italian dishes and risotto Milanese [which is made with\n          saffron] came to mind. This led me to think about saffron, and the idea of adding saffron to\n          my\n          panna cotta. After Ruth Reichl mentioned it in the New York Times review of Babbo, Mario\n          [Batali] told me I could never take it off the menu!\nSaffron has a bright metallic flavor, and with quince—which is floral, delicate, and\n          perfumed—it is wonderful. Over the years, I have found that saffron unexpectedly changes its flavor depending\n          on\n          what fruit is paired with it. Each fruit I work with either turns up its floral component or its metallic\n          flavor. Saffron is great with stone fruits like apples, peaches, pears, plums, and figs. It also works with\n          citrus like blood oranges, kumquats, and grapefruit. On the other hand, it doesn’t work with many berries. It\n          makes strawberries a little flat, and is downright awful with cranberries.",

I grew up with my father making it for us, and it\n          is\n          delicious. You’ll also see a lot of sushi chefs combine kiwi and scallops, as fruit adds a nice cleansing note\n          to the protein you are working with. Our take on this combination is pineapple salmon with\n          avocado and quinoa. We cut pineapple very thin, then wrap it around salmon belly, which is very rich. When we\n          cook it, the pineapple gets caramelized and helps cut the fat of the salmon. On the dish is a sweet-hot sauce\n          of\n          avocado, honey, scallions, and serrano chiles. To garnish the dish and add some crunch we add quinoa that is\n          cooked then dried for three days before cooking it in olive oil, which makes it puff like Rice\n          Krispies.\n      ",

The dish came\n          about\n          because I love vanilla and grapefruit. I came up with the idea that I would use dry citrus to powder my\n          scallops. Then I realized that was just one note, so I added some spice which led to star anise, fennel, and\n          anise seed. I sauce the dish with a beurre blanc and grapefruit syrup made of fresh grapefruit, candied peel,\n          and fresh vanilla bean. Since the sauce has butter and cream, I had to be careful not to turn this into\n          vanilla\n          crème brûlée! I love caramelized endive because you have a bitter vegetable that you make sweet. We cook it in\n          whole butter and just as it starts to brown we sprinkle in sugar. This balances the tart and sweet of the\n          grapefruit and the sweetness of the scallops.",

After taking them out, add chopped garlic and tomato concasse. It moves along quickly; hit it\n          with chicken stock, adjust it with some lemon juice, and let it reduce and emulsify. You add your scallops\n          back\n          in with some chiffonade of basil and it’s done.\nThe dish smells so good while you’re cooking it, between the garlic, the scallops, and the\n          duck fat.

The sauce with the skate is made from the juice from the clams, garlic,\n          anchovy,\n          and olive oil and it is finished with a parsley puree. With the fish I also serve angel hair pasta. All these\n          flavors are what you will find in white clam sauce, but are just served in a different form.",

                "We still have the same philosophy as when we opened: The fish is still the\n          star of the plate. We have not budged from there, but every dish has a sauce that completes the dish, and\n          brings\n          together all the elements on the plate and creates harmony. We pay homage to seafood and are dedicated to it,\n          but use a wide palette from rich sauces to broths and a variety of spices and emulsions.\nWhat makes a dish work is the way we make and treat our sauce. We don’t make a sauce in the\n          morning and use it for the day. Can you imagine if you made coffee in the morning and came back at noon to\n          taste\n          it? It would be disgusting. The same for tea: if you left a tea bag in your tea all day, at night it would be\n          awful.\nWe used to make a garlic sage broth and I found it to be very volatile. I realized that the\n          sauce is really only good for three minutes. After that, the sage kills the garlic or vice versa and the sauce\n          loses its balance. What we ended up doing is making a base with chicken stock, then using a tea bag with\n          ingredients in it to infuse the sauce, and we serve it right away. This sauce is paired with\n          skate roasted in goose fat with green peppercorns. On the side we serve artichokes with\n          pistachios and Parmesan cheese.",

We then mix up a bunch of eggs, combine everything together, and cook it\n            tortilla-style in a hot pan with a lot of olive oil on the stove and then in the oven to finish cooking.\n            When\n            we serve it, we cut it tortilla-style in a wedge and serve it at room temperature. The idea of eggs and\n            potatoes always feels a bit heavy, which is why there is a zesty yogurt on the plate along with a crunchy\n            watercress salad.",

I recently used it in a garlic aioli that we served with\n          calamari. It gave the mayonnaise a wonderful color, sweetness, and depth of flavor.",

We use the\n          ingredients that you would find in gazpacho but instead of using only tomatoes, we will use\n          80\n          percent strawberries and 20 percent tomatoes. My gazpacho is made up of toasted country bread, cucumber, bell\n          pepper, a little garlic, strawberries, tomatoes, olive oil, and white balsamic vinegar. The dish is then\n          garnished with Hawaiian blue prawns, diced strawberries, and slices of guanciale (cured pork jowl),\n          olive oil, basil, and black pepper.",

                "I started working on my watermelon salad years ago at Jean Georges\n          restaurant. It started out as a watermelon and goat cheese salad for summertime. The dish was a very\n          refreshing\n          summer dish with the rich goat cheese and the fresh sweet watermelon. You felt like you were eating in a\n          garden!\n          It then went on to become watermelon with fresh tomatoes, but I still wasn’t happy with it. The texture of the\n          tomato didn’t work with the texture of the watermelon. I then turned the tomatoes into a confit, cooking them\n          in\n          the oven over two hours with olive oil to concentrate their flavor. The dish is now watermelon, with a layer\n          of\n          tomato confit, topped with pistachios that just get browned in the oven, then a drizzle of olive oil and salt\n          and pepper. The whole thing is then flashed in the oven for just a minute or two to warm it. Just before\n          serving\n          it gets a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. It is not only a beautiful play of flavors, but of colors as well.",

                "With my desserts, I focus on chocolate all year round, but use it even more\n          in winter. In California, the fruit is so wonderful in the summer that that is the place to\n          focus. In summer, I can write my whole menu and forget chocolate—that is how good the fruit is here! In\n          winter,\n          it is the opposite. There are not eight unique things to focus on. So chocolate comes into play because it is\n          a\n          real comfort food and warming, too. Winter with its cool nights becomes soufflé season. Winter is when all the\n          special citrus fruits are available. Thank God for that, because you can work with Cara Cara oranges, lemon,\n          and\n          tropical fruits like passion fruit. Mangoes are available year-round, but winter is when I use them because\n          there’s no competition from berries and other summer fruits. What is great about the tropical fruits in winter\n          is that they also bring color to the menu. Pies and tarts work year-round because you can put anything in\n          them,\n          from chocolate to fruit.",

She peels the zucchini and boils them in\n          water, then purees them with a little of the water and adds a white cheese like goat or Philadelphia [cream\n          cheese], then some olive oil and salt. It is amazing! It is creamy, velvety, and refined. We cook the zucchini\n          and use the cooking water to make a gelatin. Then we take the white zucchini meat and make a mousse with olive\n          oil. So the bottom of the dish is the mousse, then a layer of seeds—cleaned one by one, which is very labor\n          intensive—then a layer of gelatin that is topped with Spanish caviar. The dish is sweet and savory, and we are\n          proud of its simplicity [of taste].",
